*** Test Cases ***
Host Should Have MicroShift-Baseline TuneD Profile Enabled
    [Documentation]    Verifies that microshift-tuned.service was successful in activating the profile
    ...    and rebooting the host.

    Kernel Arguments Should Exist    nohz=on    nohz_full=2,4-5    cu_nocbs=2,4-5    tuned.non_isolcpus=0000000b
    ...    hugepagesz=2M    hugepages=10    test1=on    test2=true    dummy
    CPUs Should Be    0    3
    CPUs Should Be    1    1    2    4    5    # 0 is implicitly online

X86 64 Should Run RT Kernel
    [Documentation]    If system under test is x86_64, assert it's running RT kernel.

    ${arch}=    Command Should Work    uname -m
    IF    "${arch}" == "x86_64"
        ${kernel}=    Command Should Work    sudo grubby --default-kernel
        Should End With    ${kernel}    +rt
    END

Kubelet Resources Are As Expected
    [Documentation]    Validates that kubelet detected right amount of online CPUs and hugepages.

    Wait Until Greenboot Health Check Exited
    Setup Kubeconfig
    Verify Node Resources    hugepages-2Mi    20Mi
    Verify Node Resources    cpu    5

Created Pod Is Guaranteed And Has Correct CPU Set
    [Documentation]    Verify that Pod has guaranteed QoS and correct CPU set.
    [Setup]    Setup Namespace

    Oc Create    -n ${NAMESPACE} -f ./assets/tuned/pod.yaml
    Named Pod Should Be Ready    oslat

    ${qos_class}=    Oc Get JsonPath    pod    ${NAMESPACE}    oslat    .status.qosClass
    Should Be Equal    ${qos_class}    Guaranteed

    ${cpus}=    Oc Exec    oslat    cat /proc/self/status | grep Cpus_allowed_list: | cut -f 2
    Should Be Equal    ${cpus}    2,4

    Wait Until Oslat Completed Testing

Make Sure Everything Works After Reboot
    [Documentation]    Verify that after reboot MicroShift is starting and our low latency Pod is running.

    Reboot MicroShift Host
    Wait Until Greenboot Health Check Exited
    Named Pod Should Be Ready    oslat

    Wait Until Oslat Completed Testing

    [Teardown]    Remove Namespace    ${NAMESPACE}

Reactivate Offline CPU
    [Documentation]    Verify if reactivating previously offlined CPU is successful.
    [Setup]    Backup MicroShift Baseline Variables

    Command Should Work
    ...    sed -i 's/^offline_cpu_set=.*$/offline_cpu_set=/' /etc/tuned/microshift-baseline-variables.conf
    Command Should Work    tuned-adm profile microshift-baseline
    CPUs Should Be    1    1    2    3    4    5    # 0 is implicitly online

    [Teardown]    Restore MicroShift Baseline Variables
